            Ten-23 isn&apos;t just a web development agency; it&apos;s a
            narrative of risk, passion, and self-discovery, founded by Natasha
            Johnson, a self-taught Software Engineer. The journey unfolded in
            2021 when I left a stable career as a Counselor in Corrections to
            pursue a <span className="italic">&apos;dream deferred&apos;</span>{" "}
            of becoming a Software Engineer. With a year-long timeline and armed
            with determination, I navigated the realm of coding using free
            online resources like YouTube tutorials and The Odin Project. To
            document the learning process, I embarked on the #100DaysOfCode
            challenge, sharing insights on Twitter. You can witness the
            inception of this journey in my Day 1 video below:

            The name Ten-23 holds profound meaning â€“ a tribute to my late
            grandmother, a steadfast pillar of support throughout my journey.
            Despite her passing just months before landing my first role, her
            spirit lives on in the agency&apos;s name, symbolizing her October
            23rd birthday.

            seamlessly aligns with my role, fostering a fondness for front-end
            web development. In the quest for mastery, I continually explore new
            tools and techniques, dedicating my spare time to enhancing my craft
            that I can pass on to clients.
